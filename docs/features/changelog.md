# Changelog

`GET /changelog` is public. It lists the last 30 `Release <version>: …` commits on the default branch of the forge's own repository (`FORGE_REPO`), newest first. Each has a heading anchored `#<version>`, its date, and one link per pull named in the subject (`title (#N);title (#N)`). When `FORGE_REPO` is unset or its repository is private, the page answers 200 with "No releases yet". The footer links to it.

One bounded `git log` read, cached per head oid; Server-Timing names `releases` and `render`.
